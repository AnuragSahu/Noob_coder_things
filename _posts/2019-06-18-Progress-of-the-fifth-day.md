title: "Progress on the Fifth Day."

Today I went ahead and made an account in <a href="https://www.spoj.com">SPOJ</a> (Sphere Online Judge).

I have been reading a lot about competitive coding and Stunmbled upon this really helpfull website called careerhigh.in They have very nicely explained the Roadmap to Competitive coding, 

So following the same I went in SPOJ, they are at a totally different level than what Hackerrank was, In HackerRank the Approch was very unclear, in SPOJ they will giving you very standerd problems using Stacks and Data structures, 

In SPOJ they won't tell you the Testcases But it Is ok I guess,

Today I solved Three Problems in SPOJ,
- Life, the Universe, and Everything
- Prime Generator
- Transform the Expression

* I also tried to solve the Problem The Next Palindrome, but haven't implemented it yet.

Well nothing much of progress but Still doing something will contiue the struggle.
