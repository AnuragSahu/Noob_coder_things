Today I went ahead and made an account in <a href="https://www.spoj.com">SPOJ</a> (Sphere Online Judge).

I have been reading a lot about competitive coding and Stunmbled upon this really helpfull website called careerhigh.in They have very nicely explained the Roadmap to Competitive coding, 

So following the same I went in SPOJ, they are at a totally different level than what Hackerrank was, In HackerRank the Approch was very unclear, in SPOJ they will giving you very standerd problems using Stacks and Data structures, 

In SPOJ they won't tell you the Testcases But it Is ok I guess,

Today I solved Three Problems in SPOJ,
- Life, the Universe, and Everything
- Prime Generator
- Transform the Expression

* I also tried to solve the Problem The Next Palindrome, but haven't implemented it yet.

Also there was Also a very wierd Problem list on the 3 number called SubString Check(Bug Funny), It was suppossed to be solved by only either of the following Language
- <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck">BrainF**k</a>
- <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitespace_(programming_language)">Whitespace</a>
- <a href="https://www.whoishostingthis.com/resources/intercal/">Intercal</a>

I didn't had the code even Hello World in any of these Languages.

Well nothing much of progress but Still doing something will contiue the struggle.
