Today I am over welmed with the work I did, although I did not do any thing out of the way I only went to the HackerRank website andd started solving some of the problems.

HackerRank is one of the best plaotforms to Start with Compeditive coding specialy if you are starting from Strach it will give you some really simple problems to solve, you can even see the testcases in which your code fails.

Though I had already solved all of the implementation problems in past but in C language and since I was giving it a new start with C++ as my favrioute language, I resloved them in C++, I Solved 11 Problems in C++ in HackerRank.

Here is The List of Problems I have solved in HackerRank:-
1. Solve Me First
2. Simple Array Sum
3. Compare the Triplets
4. A very Big Sum
5. Diagonal Difference
6. Plus Minus
7. Staircase
8. Mini-Max Sum
9. Birthday Cake Candles
10. Time COnversion
11. Grading Students

From Todays session I was able to Learn more about the usage and different type of Operators in C++, Implementations help you to have a clear Idea of the Operators in C++, Today  learned about the most Amazing thing in C++ that is vectors, It is dynamic and it is just inbuit just we have to import the header file by calling

{% highlight ruby %}
#include<vector>
{% endhighlight %}

Also I have made my templete file for C++

{% highlight ruby %}
#include<iostream>
#include<cmath>
#include<vector>

int main(){
	/* Your code goes here */
	return 0;
}
{% endhighlight %}

and thats was all for the Day. Happy Learning!
