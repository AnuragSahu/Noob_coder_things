title: "About my skill Levels at the start of CP."
---


This is the my first post of the Compedetive Programming journey which I pledge to take and excel at or atlest be good enough.
- I aim to score 2000 ratings in Codechef.
- being able to qualify at the collage level APM-ICPC at IIIT Hyderabad.
- Treat it more like a sport.
- Enjoy the process more than to take it as burden.

My Current Status at Coding
- Did some nominal Coding at the First Semester.
- Also tried with Compedetive coding in starter platforms like HackerRank.
- Failed Miserably to shift to Code-Chef and Code fources.
- Also tried some leet coding did okish wasn't able to continue.
- Haven't really did any compedetive coding,
- Never took any challanges,
- Never took part in any of the codefources challange.

How Do I plan to go with it.
- Follow a proper method.
- If you fall then make sure to stand back up.
- Restart fresh.
- Patience is the key.
- Study before doing it.
- You are not a bond.
- I will be following the Roadmap to Competitive Programming for Beginners by CareerHigh
- link - https://careerhigh.in/roadmap/9/
- Don't Break Again, and even if you break make sure that you are back again.

According to it STEP - 1,
- Learn a well - known programming Language
- I will be using C++ , it is widely used in the world,
- Many of my fellow coders use C++,
- its is the fastest.
- Will do the Proper Online C++ coding tutorial for Competitive coding.
